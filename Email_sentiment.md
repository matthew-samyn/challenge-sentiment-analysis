## Mission objectives

- Be able interact with Twitter's API.
- Be able create a sentiment analysis model.

## The Mission

You just got an internship at Netflix. As a first task, they ask you to analyze people's reaction to their new show "The Queen's Gambit" on Twitter.
They are only interested in English speaker's reactions.

### Must-have features

- You scrapped at least 10000 tweets in English containing the hashtag `#queengambit`. You may also select another series or movie.
- You predicted an overall sentiment out of all those tweets.

### Steps

#### Step 1: Scraping

Scrap the **10000 most recent English tweets** with the hashtag: `#queengambit`.

You can use the Twitter API (recommended) or do it with the classical scrapping methods.

#### Step 2: preprocessing

Preprocess the data.

#### Step 3: Modeling

Find a sentiment analysis dataset that matches your use-case.
Then, create a sentiment analysis model.

#### Step 4: Evaluate your model

Make sure your model predicts right.

#### Step 5: Predict the overall sentiment

Now that your model is ready, extract the general sentiment out of your scrapped data.

#### Step 6: double check

Randomly check a few tweets to verify that your model predicts the right sentiment.

#### Step 7: readme file

Prepare a readme file with all the insights that you have gathered about the show's reactions. (brief)

#### Bonus: Make an API

- Make an API that accepts a hashtag in the route `/predict`.
- Run the complete pipeline to predict the sentiment out of your hashtag.
- Wrap the API in a Docker container.
- Deploy it on Heroku.

## Deliverables

1. Pimp up the README file:
